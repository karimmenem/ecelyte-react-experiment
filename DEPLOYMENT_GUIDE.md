## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect to Vercel account
3. Deploy with one click
4. Domain will be automatically assigned

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
